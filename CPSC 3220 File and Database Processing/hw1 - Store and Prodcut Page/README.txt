Hello! Please open "homepage.html" in your browser to access what is obviously meant to be the homepage.

HTML and CSS files have been scrubbed of comments to leave only the functional bits behind. (We once had a CSS-based table mostly finished for the product page, but we weren't sure if using HTML tables was necessary or not, so that idea got scrapped entirely.)

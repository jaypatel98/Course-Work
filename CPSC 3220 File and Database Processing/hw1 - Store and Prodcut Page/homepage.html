        Manson's Store for Manly Men is proud to be the manliest enstablishment ever created by Mankind. Founded on January 30, 1835 by Manson Mann after he reportedly witnessed a large man drink several liters of beer in one sitting, the store was realized for the single purpose of "Capturing the unbridled manliness of that guy. What a lad." So tell us: Have we lived up to that dream? Your answer is yes. Don't even think twice about it.
